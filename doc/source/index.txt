   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Simple Django feedback application usage
========================================


1. Install application
``````````````````````

    Add ``feedback`` to INSTALLED_APPS::
        
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            ...
            'feedback',
            ...
        ]

2. Load and use feedback template tags 
``````````````````````````````````````
    
    Insert 

        ``{% load feedback_tags %}``

    in your template and insert
    
        ``{% show_feedback %}``
    
    template tag in your template, where you want to see feedback form.

.. describe:: Requriments

   Note that feedback uses ajax form based on jQuery, so you need to include jQuery
   in your page. You can install it from Google hosting. Just include 

        ``<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"></script>``

    in ``<head>`` element.
    
3. Install feedback in urlconf
``````````````````````````````
    Just include::
        
        (r'^feedback', include('feedback.urls'))

    in urlpatterns. That's all!


4. Customize
````````````

    Application uses following templates:

        ``fedback/feedback.html`` - to render feedback form
        
        ``fedback/feedback_page.html`` - to render a page with feedback form

        ``feedback/thankyou.html`` - to render message after submit

        ``feedback/feedback_message.txt`` - to render message, that will 
        be sent after user posts form

	You can customize these settings in your settings.py:
	

		``FEEDBACK_FORM`` - form, that will be displayed to user. 
		By default form contains email, topic and response fields
		
		``DIRECT_TO_TEMPLATE`` - Should application render feedback form 
		direct to template ``feedback/feedback_page.html``, or you prefer to use
		template tag in other templates.
